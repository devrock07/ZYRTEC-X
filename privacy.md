_Last updated: November 2025_

This Privacy Policy explains how our Discord bot (“the Bot”) collects, uses, and protects data when used in any Discord server. By adding or using the Bot, you agree to the terms in this policy.

## 📌 1. Information We Collect

### **1.1 Message Content**
The Bot reads message content only for:
- Running prefix commands  
- Automoderation (anti-spam, bad-word filter, link filter, etc.)  
- Custom commands & autoresponders  
- AI chat replies  
- Utility commands (math, translate, tools)

**The bot does *not* store message content permanently or outside Discord.**

---

### **1.2 Presence & User Status**
Presence data (online, idle, offline, activities) is used for:
- Leveling systems  
- Online staff alerts  
- Security & antinuke automation

**The bot does not save presence status outside Discord.**

---

### **1.3 Basic Discord Data**
The bot may temporarily process:
- User ID  
- Username  
- Avatar  
- Server ID  
- Channel ID  
- Roles  

This data is required for core bot functionality (moderation, commands, permissions).

## 📌 2. How Data Is Used

The Bot uses collected data ONLY to:
- Execute commands  
- Perform server automation  
- Provide antinuke & moderation features  
- Respond to users via AI or autoresponse

Data is **never sold, shared, or used for advertising**.

These services only receive the data required to generate the requested output (e.g., your prompt).

Users can opt-out by:
